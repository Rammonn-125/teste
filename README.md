# Technical Test
## API to manage tasks

Following the instructions sent by email I tried to develop this API to manage tasks, including CRUD functionalities. Guided by the documentation available and some forums on the internet.
To locally run the application first we start *Apache* and *MySQL* (database of choice) through *Xampp*, access http://localhost:5000 for the *index* page and the application is ready to go.

I don't have much experience with backend development so it was quite difficult go throught each step. It's the first time I apply for this kind o job and I don't have much familiarity with it and tried my best to complete this test. There will be errors and a few things not working properly with de api.
